# OneStop Chrome Extension

## 🚧 Work In Progress

This project is currently under development as part of my learning journey through **MLH Global Hack Week**. The goal is to build a Chrome extension and a companion website that helps developers manage and organize resources during project development.

Inspired by tools like [raindrop.io](https://raindrop.io/), **OneStop** is tailored specifically for developers.
